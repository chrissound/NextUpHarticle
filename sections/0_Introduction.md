# {{sectionHeader}} - Introduction

Right, so this is a first tutorial / guide / technical article I'm writing with Hart - <https://github.com/chrissound/Hart>. This means you will be able to clone down this project and follow along (and hack) at each section - seriously just do this:

```
git clone https://github.com/chrissound/NextUpHarticle
```

Within each section there will be two commits, the 'from' commit which is BEFORE the changes have occured relating to that section, and the `until` commit which is AFTER. So after cloning down the repo you can do a `git reset --HARD commitIdBEFORE` and follow along with the changes, or just `git reset --HARD commitIdAFTER` to see the end result of that section.

Feedback is always appreciated. 

Right so what are we building here? We'll be building a simple command line based, todo list manager.
